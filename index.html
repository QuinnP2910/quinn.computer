                                        A major focus of my life has been my
                                        academics. I really enjoy learning,
                                        especially when it comes to STEM
                                        fields.<br /><br />

                                        In my Junior year of high school, I
                                        decided to take part in my school's
                                        <strong>Running Start</strong> program.
                                        I went full-time my Senior year, and in
                                        total, I had enough college credits to
                                        graduate with an Associate degree
                                        simultaneously with my high school
                                        graduation.<br /><br />

                                        Additionally, I maintained a perfect
                                        <strong>4.0 GPA</strong> in both my high
                                        school and college courses. This earned
                                        me the title of
                                        <strong>Valedictorian</strong> with my
                                        high school, and earned me the
                                        <strong>President's Distinction</strong>
                                        at my Running Start college.<br /><br />

                                        I have been a part of a robotics team
                                        since 5th grade, all through
                                        <strong>FIRST</strong>. For the first 4
                                        years, I participated in
                                        <strong>FLL</strong>, which is a program
                                        for younger students to learn the basics
                                        of designing, building, and programming
                                        a small LEGO robot.<br /><br />

                                        However, the most impactful experience
                                        I've had with robotics was during my
                                        time in high school when I joined
                                        <strong>FRC team 2910</strong>. In this
                                        program, students build large 100-pound
                                        robots to compete in yearly challenges.
                                        My team was one of the
                                        <strong>best in the world</strong>, and
                                        I had the amazing opportunity to spend
                                        the 2022 and 2023 seasons as the
                                        <strong>lead software developer</strong

                                        <strong>mentors</strong> who are experts
                                        in their respective industries. We had
                                        mechanical mentors from Boeing, software
                                        mentors from Microsoft, etc. To see a

                                        Here is a video of our 2022 robot
                                        performing very highly in the
                                        <em>autonomous period</em>, a period in
                                        which the robot runs exclusively on
                                        software. I wrote the code running in
                                        this video. Our bot was one of the only
                                        in the world that could perform this
                                        "6-Ball Auto".<br /><br />

                                        Not only did I participate in FIRST
                                        robotics as a student, see
                                        <em>Robotics</em>, I also spent much
                                        time volunteering at competitions. I
                                        volunteered at all levels of competition
                                        and in numerous different roles.<br /><br />

                                        I really enjoyed volunteering at FIRST
                                        competitions. I saw myself in the
                                        students there, and I loved being able
                                        to give back to the community that gave
                                        so much to me. These competitions are
                                        generally full-day events, so I've
                                        likely spent cumulatively 100-200 hours
                                        volunteering for FIRST. Below is a list
                                        of roles I've filled.<br /><br />

                                        <h4>Roles</h4>
                                        <strong>Queuer</strong><br />
                                        Teams need to know where to go, whether
                                        it's time for them to play a match or
                                        time for them to present a project in
                                        front of a panel of judges. As a Queuer,
                                        you make sure every team gets where they
                                        need to be. It involves working
                                        collaboratively with a large group of
                                        other Queuers to ensure a competition
                                        runs smoothly.<br /><br />

                                        <strong>Set-up and tear-down</strong
                                        ><br />
                                        These play-fields can be very in-depth.
                                        At the level of FRC, they are generally
                                        the size of a basketball court, and
                                        there are often multiple fields.
                                        Essentially, you have to turn a school's
                                        gymnasium into an arena for these games
                                        along with a "pit" area where teams stay
                                        between matches. I've spent much time
                                        helping set-up and tear-down these
                                        events.<br /><br />

                                        <strong>Judge</strong><br />
                                        At earlier levels of FIRST, students are
                                        tasked to come up with some STEM-related
                                        solution to a world dilemma, such as
                                        producing clean energy or
                                        transportation. They create a
                                        presentation and present it to a board
                                        of "judges" who grade their solution. I
                                        volunteered as one of these judges.<br /><br />

                                        <strong>Referee</strong><br />
                                        It's imperative to ensure that all rules
                                        are being followed to a T during
                                        robotics matches. I filled the role of a
                                        referee, ensuring that all teams were
                                        playing the game as intended. This is
                                        important to ensure the creation of a
                                        playing field that feels level and
                                        fair.<br /><br />

                                        <h5>Outreach</h5>
                                        In my time on my robotics team, I
                                        participated in many "outreach" events
                                        in which we bring our robot to an event
                                        or location and demonstrate its
                                        abilities. The goal of these events is
                                        to instill interest in STEM to children
                                        who may not have had much exposure to
                                        the field.<br /><br />

                                        My team and I went to the

                                        in Everett, <strong>Seafair</strong> in
                                        Seattle,
                                        <strong>Boeing Family Day</strong>, and
                                        even lower-level FIRST competitions
                                        hosted by our school district. There's
                                        really nothing more rewarding than
                                        seeing young people show interest in a
                                        program I work so closely with.<br /><br />

                                        I even got the chance to lead a
                                        presentation at
                                        <strong>Nintendo of America</strong>
                                        regarding the software of our robot,
                                        which was an extremely valuable
                                        experience.

                                        At this job, I worked as a computer
                                        science tutor with young children and
                                        taught them the basics of coding. I used
                                        languages like Python and Scratch to
                                        introduce them to basic programming
                                        concepts. I worked with ages from
                                        pre-school to middle, and I learned a
                                        ton about lesson planning and
                                        leadership.

                                        information on my experience with
                                        robots. Through my time as the lead
                                        software developer on my robotics team,
                                        I learned <strong>Java</strong> at a
                                        high level. I also learned how to use
                                        <strong>libraries</strong> and

                                        using these libraries and hardware
                                        clients. I learned how to develop code
                                        for
                                        <strong>autonomous motion</strong>
                                        through path planning and trajectory
                                        following, along with
                                        <strong>computer vision</strong> to
                                        target goals or re-localize the position
                                        of the robot on the field. I've learned
                                        how to program
                                        <strong>embedded systems</strong>,
                                        <strong>motor controllers</strong>, and

                                        along with
                                        <strong>control systems</strong> using
                                        things like a

                                        I even learned how to program
                                        <strong>Android apps</strong> for use in
                                        our "scouting app", which makes use of
                                        QR codes to wirelessly transfer data
                                        about other robots, collected through
                                        the app by "scouts".<br /><br />

                                        <h5>Soft Skills</h5>
                                        Through my time as a tutor (see
                                        <em>Job History</em>) and having a
                                        leadership position on my robotics team,
                                        I've picked up many soft skills. I've
                                        gotten good at
                                        <strong>public speaking</strong> along
                                        with things like
                                        <strong>teamwork</strong>,
                                        <strong>leadership</strong>, and
                                        <strong>conflict resolution</strong>.
                                        Robotics is also very fast-paced,
                                        demanding strong
                                        <strong>planning</strong> and
                                        <strong>communication</strong>
                                        skills<br /><br />

                                        Additionally, as a student, I've gotten
                                        very good at
                                        <strong>time-management</strong>,
                                        <strong>critical-thinking</strong>, and
                                        <strong>self-motivation</strong>. I find
                                        that these skills are crucial to have in
                                        almost all areas of life, and I pride
                                        myself on them.

                                        This code I wrote much less of. That's
                                        because our programming team grew quite
                                        large and I took on a much more
                                        logistics-based role, overseeing and
                                        mentoring less experienced programmers.
                                        This code also won an award and brought
                                        our team many 1st place victories.<br /><br />

                                        This is a React-based website that makes

                                        APIs to create an environment in which
                                        users can take notes on songs as they
                                        listen to them. There are too many

                                        of albums. I loaded this with features,

                                        of the YouTube API which allows users to

                                        into the review. This also uses MongoDB

                                        As forms of art and self-expression, I'm
                                        really into music and photography.<br /><br />

                                        <h5>Music</h5>
                                        For about 3 years now I've been playing
                                        guitar (both acoustic and electric) and
                                        studying music theory. I've made it a
                                        goal of mine to spend at least 15
                                        minutes each day playing (when
                                        possible), which is a goal I've been
                                        able to maintain. Writing and playing
                                        music is a massive artistic outlet for
                                        me.<br /><br />

                                        I also really enjoy listening to and
                                        critically reviewing music. I listen to
                                        about 100,000 minutes of music a year
                                        according to my Spotify statistics.
                                        Going to concerts and seeing live music
                                        is a favorite pastime of mine as well.
                                        See <em>Projects</em> for examples of
                                        how I've incorporated this love of music
                                        with Computer Science.<br /><br />

                                        <h5>Photography</h5>
                                        For almost as long as I can remember,
                                        I've enjoyed taking pictures.
                                        Specifically, nature photography is a
                                        favorite of mine. This past summer, I
                                        spent much time hiking to scenic or
                                        driving to abandoned locations to do
                                        photo-shoots.<br /><br />

                                        To see some of my guitar playing and
                                        photography, see
